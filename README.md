## General

A small Unreal Engine game developed mainly for learning purposes. The focus is mainly on C++ programming and less on Blueprints and visual appearance. Inspired by a game called _Banished_.

## Description

In this game you have a bunch of residents to which you may assign different roles: worker, builder, gatherer and tree cutter. Other than that you cannot control your residents but they work on their own once a role has been assigned. Your goal is to increase the amount of residents in your village by building more houses.

*Worker* carries wood from storage to buildings.

*Tree cutter* gathers wood from trees to storage so that new houses can be built.

*Builder* does the actual construction of the buildings (house and storage).

*Gatherer* gathers food so that the residents do not starve.
